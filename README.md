## About Me

My name is Sadoon Hammadie and I'm a proficient data analyst. My journey started in high school when I was given access to the school's database to create predictive models for student attendance. Ever since my first project in high school I fell in love with data analysis. I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering specilizing in material analysis where my data analysis skills came in play. I was the only student in my classes that was using excel and SQL to process the lab data. Professors liked the different skillset I possessed and decided to work with me where I was given multiple research projects outside my class work. Once I graduated I realized that I want to pursue data analysis full time. Deciding to shift careers immediately after college was contested by my friends and family but my confidence in my skillset made the decision seemless and natural. I have worked on many projects since I graduated college and this portofolio is my way of showcasing what I'm capable of. I plan to further expand my knowledge in this field and knowing that this industry is only starting to take off brings the excited little kid in me that's always seeking new adventures.
